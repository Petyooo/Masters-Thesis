# Masters-Thesis

This is the PowerPoint presentation for my Master's Thesis Defence at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB).

The subject of the thesis was Multi-Focus Image Fusion, where the focused regions of a near-focused and a complementary far-focused image are fused to create an artificial all-in-focus image.
